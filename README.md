🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/indrajitdey/DataTalk-talk-with-your-data.git
cd DataTalk-talk-with-your-data

2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
.venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root:

SQL_USER=your_username
SQL_PASSWORD=your_password
SQL_HOST=localhost
SQL_DATABASE=your_db_name
API_KEY=your_api_key   # if needed

5️⃣ Initialize Database Schema (⚠️ First-time only)

Run the following to fetch and save schema details from your database:

python schema.py


This step ensures the application knows your database structure before handling queries.

6️⃣ Run the Application
python app.py


Server will start at:
👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000/

📡 API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/query	Send natural language query → SQL
GET	/health	Check if API is running
POST	/execute	Run SQL query on connected database

(Add more here depending on your routes)
